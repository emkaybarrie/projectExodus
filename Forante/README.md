## What is Forante?

Forante is not a product company. It is an **institutional holding** that:

1. **Owns and evolves the Forge** — the AI-native SDLC operating system
2. **Governs the entity network** — sets rules for how entities are built and operate
3. **Maintains shared infrastructure** — services that entities can opt into
4. **Preserves institutional integrity** — methodology over velocity

## The Model 3 Relationship

```
Forante (You are here)
    │
    └── Forge (Institutional OS)
            │
            └── Entities
                    ├── MyFi (Flagship)
                    └── [Future Entities]
```

- **Forante** sets constitutional law
- **Forge** implements operational law
- **Entities** build products within that law
- **MyFi** is the flagship entity and Forge proving ground
