/* src/screens/quests/uplift.css
   Optional screen-level uplift for Quests.

   Purpose:
   - Adjust spacing/layout/positioning for the Quests screen as a whole.
   - Keep part wiring safe: do NOT style global selectors.

   SAFE AI WORKFLOW:
   - AI may edit this file freely.
   - Scope everything under `.questsScreen`.
   - To revert: blank this file.
*/

/* Example (commented):
.questsScreen .questsScroll{ padding-top: 10px; }
*/
