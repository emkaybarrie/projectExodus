# Hub2 screen uplift prompt

You are editing **ONLY** `src/screens/hub2/uplift.css`.

Rules:
- Keep all selectors scoped under `.hub2-screen`.
- Do not introduce IDs.
- Do not modify HTML or JS.
- Prefer minimal diffs.

Context:
- Hub2 is a JSON-first Surfaces Studio dry-run for recreating the Hub screen.
- Parts are mounted into slots defined by `surface.json`.
- The goal is to change look/spacing/typography safely (no functional drift).

Ask: Apply the requested visual changes in CSS.
