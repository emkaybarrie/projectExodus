You are generating a NEW UI PRIMITIVE for Project MyFi.

You will be given:
- contract.json (READ-ONLY rules)
- uplift.css (EDITABLE)
- part.js (LOCKED stub; DO NOT EDIT unless explicitly allowed)

Rules:
- Only output the full contents of uplift.css.
- All selectors MUST be scoped under `.Part-<Kind>`.
- Do not reference global elements (body, html, .screen-root).
- Keep it lightweight and mobile friendly.
