# Genome Contract

Status: Canonical (FCL v1)
Last Updated: 2026-01-29
Scope: Defines artifact classification, graduation ritual, and evolution governance

---

## Purpose

The Genome is the Forge's **artifact classification system**. It distinguishes between:

- **Stable** artifacts: Constitutional, proven, change-controlled
- **Experimental** artifacts: New, under observation, lighter review

The Graduation Ritual governs how artifacts move from Experimental to Stable.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Visibility** — Classification is visible, not hidden metadata
2. **Policy** — Clear rules, not complex scoring systems
3. **Evidence-Based** — Graduation requires observable proof
4. **Director-Approved** — No automatic promotions
5. **Non-Bureaucratic** — Lightweight process, real value

---

## Two-Speed Genome

### Stable Artifacts

Constitutional artifacts that have graduated to production stability.

**Characteristics:**
- Proven over observation period (14+ days)
- No critical regressions during observation
- Smoke tests passing
- No open alert-level Reflex warnings tied to artifact
- Director-approved for stability

**Change Requirements:**
- Changes require Work Order with regression review
- Verifier-Tester sign-off recommended
- Higher scrutiny on modifications

**Examples:**
- FORGE_KERNEL.md
- FORGE_STATE.md
- FORGE_CAPSULE.md
- All contracts in `/contracts/`
- Core playbooks in `/ops/`

### Experimental Artifacts

New features or changes under observation.

**Characteristics:**
- Less than 14 days since introduction, OR
- Pending graduation review, OR
- Explicitly marked experimental

**Change Requirements:**
- Changes still require Work Order
- Lighter review burden
- Encouraged iteration

**Examples:**
- New portal features (M3/M4)
- New workflows
- FCL v1 cognition layer (until graduated)

  "stable": [
    {
      "path": "artifact path",

}

## Graduation Ritual

### Prerequisites (ALL must be true)

| Criterion | Check | Evidence Source |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| **Observation Period** | ≥ 14 days since introduction | `experimental.observationStart` |
| **Smoke Tests** | Passing | `observations.smokePass` |
| **No Critical Regressions** | No regression incidents | Chronicler records |
| **No Alert-Level Warnings** | No open alerts tied to artifact | Reflex warnings |
| **Director Approval** | Explicit sign-off | Graduation WO |

### Graduation Process

```
1. Artifact reaches 14-day observation period
   ↓
2. Portal shows "Eligible for Graduation" indicator
   ↓
3. Director reviews evidence:
   - Observation duration
   - Smoke test history
   - Reflex warning history
   - Any incidents involving artifact
   ↓
4. Director clicks "Draft Graduation WO"
   ↓
5. Graduation WO is reviewed and approved
   ↓
6. Artifact moves from Experimental → Stable
   ↓
7. Chronicler records graduation event
```

### Graduation WO Template

```markdown
# Work Order: Graduate {artifact} to Stable

**Type:** governance
**Status:** Draft

## Artifact Details

- **Path:** {artifact path}
- **Introduced:** {date}
- **Observation Period:** {days} days

## Evidence Review

- [ ] Observation period ≥ 14 days: {yes/no}
- [ ] Smoke tests passing throughout: {yes/no}
- [ ] No critical regressions: {yes/no}
- [ ] No open alert-level warnings: {yes/no}

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Artifact moved to Stable classification
- [ ] FSP genome section updated
- [ ] Chronicler graduation event recorded

## Director Sign-off

I confirm this artifact has demonstrated stability and is approved for
graduation to Stable status.

## Eligibility Calculation

An artifact is eligible for graduation when:

```javascript
eligible = (
  daysSinceIntroduction >= 14 &&
  observations.smokePass === true &&
  !hasAlertWarnings(artifactPath) &&
  !hasCriticalRegressions(artifactPath)
)
```

### Eligibility Reasons

| Reason | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `eligible` | All criteria met, ready for graduation |
| `observation_pending` | Less than 14 days since introduction |
| `smoke_failing` | Smoke tests not passing |
| `alert_warnings` | Open alert-level warnings tied to artifact |
| `regression_detected` | Critical regression recorded for artifact |

---

## Portal Integration

### Genome Panel

New panel in Forge tab showing:

**Header:**
- "Genome" title
- Stable count / Experimental count

**Stable Section:**
- List of stable artifacts (collapsed by default)
- Each shows: name, path, graduation date

**Experimental Section:**
- List of experimental artifacts
- Each shows: name, path, days since introduction
- Eligibility indicator:
  - 🟢 "Eligible" — ready for graduation
  - 🟡 "X days remaining" — observation in progress
  - 🔴 "Blocked: {reason}" — issue preventing graduation

**Actions:**
- "Draft Graduation WO" button (for eligible artifacts)
- Link to Genome Contract docs

### Director Workflow

1. Open Portal → Forge tab → Genome panel
2. See Experimental artifacts with eligibility status
3. For eligible artifacts, click "Draft Graduation WO"
4. Copy draft, review evidence, submit for approval
5. After approval, artifact graduates

---

## Chronicler Integration

### Graduation Event

When an artifact graduates, Chronicler records:

```json
{
  "eventType": "graduation",
  "domain": "genome",
  "summary": "Artifact {name} graduated to Stable",
  "details": {
    "artifactPath": "/path/to/artifact",
    "artifactName": "Artifact Name",
    "observationDays": 14,
    "graduationWoId": "FO-XXX",
    "approvedBy": "director"
  }
}
```

### Introduction Event

When an artifact is introduced as Experimental:

```json
{
  "eventType": "artifact_introduced",
  "domain": "genome",
  "summary": "Artifact {name} introduced as Experimental",
  "details": {
    "artifactPath": "/path/to/artifact",
    "artifactName": "Artifact Name",
    "introducedBy": "who",
    "introducingWoId": "FO-XXX"
  }
}
```

## What Genome Does NOT Do (v1)

1. **No automatic promotions** — Director approval required
2. **No auto-enforced blocks** — Classification is advisory
3. **No complex scoring** — Simple criteria, clear thresholds
4. **No automatic demotions** — Regression handling is separate process

---

## FSP Integration

Genome data lives in FSP under the `genome` key:

```json
{
  "genome": {
    "stable": ["list of stable artifact paths"],
    "experimental": ["list of experimental artifact paths"],
    "graduationPending": ["list of artifacts awaiting graduation"]
  }
}
```

Portal enriches this with eligibility calculations at runtime.

---

## Evolution Loop

The Genome enables safe self-improvement:

```
New feature introduced → Experimental
        ↓
Observation period (14 days)
        ↓
Evidence collected (smoke, reflex, chronicler)
        ↓
Director reviews eligibility
        ↓
Graduation WO approved → Stable
        ↓
Artifact now has higher change scrutiny
```

This prevents:
- Untested changes becoming canon
- Silent drift from experimental to assumed-stable
- Evolution without evidence
