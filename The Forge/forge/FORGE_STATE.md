Status: Canonical
Audience: All agents
Last updated: Initialisation (v1.0)

1. Current Institutional Mode

The MyFi Forge is operating in Dual-Track Mode.

Track A: Forge construction and institutional hardening

Track B: MyFi product development and iteration

Neither track is subordinate.
Agents must always consider whether work advances:

the product,

the institution,

or both.

If a task advances neither, it must be challenged.

2. Agent Availability Assumptions

The Forge must remain operational under the following conditions:

Repo-aware Executor (Claude): optional / not yet onboarded

Architect (non-repo AI): available

Director (human): available but not always fully specified

Agents must not assume:

direct repo access

full code visibility

or synchronous human oversight

Process guidance and enforcement must function regardless.

3. Active Focus Areas

The Forge recognises the following as active and legitimate work domains:

3.1 Institutional Build-Out

Defining Forge artifacts

Codifying process rules

Designing self-correction and evolution loops

Preparing Claude onboarding pathway

Creating the Forge Capsule (portable truth layer)

3.2 MyFi Product Work

Hub / Vitals architecture

Quests and Journeys

UI systems (Surfaces / Slots / Parts)

Behavioural mechanics (Essence, Vitals, Shields)

Demo and pilot readiness

Work in either domain is allowed, provided it follows Forge process.

4. Explicit Non-Goals (Temporary)

Until further notice, the Forge must not prioritise:

Large-scale refactors without Executor oversight

Performance micro-optimisation

Visual polish beyond functional clarity

New subsystems without clear spec lineage

This is a stabilisation phase, not an expansion phase.

5. Known Risks & Watch Areas

Agents must be alert to the following risks:

Process drift: reverting to free-form prompting or ad-hoc decisions

Over-formalisation: process becoming heavier than value delivered

Agent overreach: AI making irreversible decisions without approval

Vision dilution: MyFi mechanics drifting from behavioural intent

If detected, agents must pause work and surface the risk explicitly.

6. Allowed Agent Behaviour (Without Claude)

In the absence of a repo-aware Executor:

Agents may:

design specs

critique architecture

propose refactors conceptually

prepare work orders

generate portable artifacts

Agents must not:

assume code reality without evidence

claim implementation correctness

silently invent APIs or structures

All outputs must be clearly labelled as:

Design

Spec

Proposal

or Process Artifact

7. Definition of “Ready for Claude”

The Forge considers itself ready to onboard a repo-aware Executor when:

Forge Kernel is stable

Forge State is current

Forge Lessons contains at least initial entries

Forge Capsule exists and is up to date

Work Orders are consistently used

Specs exist for at least one full MyFi workflow

Until then, Claude onboarding is deferred by design.

8. Next Required Action (Self-Signposted)

Given the current state, the Forge requires the creation of a portable truth layer so that all agents—repo-aware or not—can reason coherently.

The next mandatory artifact is:

📄 FORGE_CAPSULE.md

This artifact will:

summarise the Forge in a compact, shareable form

enable cross-agent coherence

allow non-repo agents to guide process enforcement accurately

No further execution work should proceed until the Capsule exists.
