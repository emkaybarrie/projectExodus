# Forge Index

This document is a navigational index to Forge artifacts.

## Authority Clarification
- `FORGE_MANIFEST.json` is the **machine-authoritative definition** of the Forge
- This file is **non-authoritative**
- This file exists for orientation and discovery only

If there is any conflict between this index and the manifest:
- The manifest wins
