# Forge Index

This document is a navigational index to Forge artifacts.

## Authority Clarification
- `FORGE_MANIFEST.json` is the **machine-authoritative definition** of the Forge
- This file is **non-authoritative**
- This file exists for orientation and discovery only

If there is any conflict between this index and the manifest:
- The manifest wins

## Core Artifacts
- FORGE_KERNEL.md — operational law
- FORGE_MANIFEST.json — machine authority
- FORGE_CAPSULE.md — conceptual identity
- TASK_WORK_ORDER.md — execution contract
- ONBOARDING_WIZARD.md — human + agent onboarding

End of Index.
