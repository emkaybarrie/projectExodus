# Forge Share Pack

This folder contains a minimal, always-up-to-date snapshot of Forge + MyFi
for non-repo-aware agents.

## Governance Model

**Model 3: Forge as Institutional OS, MyFi as Flagship Entity**

- **Constitutional Layer:** Forante (steward company)
- **Institutional OS:** Forge (SDLC operating system)
- **Flagship Entity:** MyFi (Tier 2 integration, proving ground)

See: [Forante Kernel](../../../Forante/FORANTE_KERNEL.md) for full constitutional governance.
