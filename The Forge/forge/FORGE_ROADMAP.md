🧭 FORGE_ROADMAP.md

Status: Canonical · Automation-Oriented
Audience: All agents and Director
Purpose: Track institutional capabilities and proximity to automation
Model: Capability Matrix (not linear stages)

How to Read This Roadmap

Each capability represents something the Forge must be able to do.

Capabilities move through states:

Absent

Defined

Operational

Enforced

Automatable

The Forge’s objective is not “completion”, but progressive reduction of human coordination cost.

Capability Matrix
1. Process Governance
Capability	Description	Status
Forge Constitution	Clear, enforceable process law	Enforced

2. Work Intake & Execution
Capability	Description	Status
Structured Work Orders	All work formalised	Enforced
Underspec Recovery	Partial templates returned	Enforced
Scope & Mutability Control	Agents refuse invalid tasks	Operational
Post-Task Reflection	Learning captured consistently	Operational
3. Institutional Memory
Capability	Description	Status
Lessons Log	Narrative + structured learning	Enforced
Anti-Pattern Awareness	Known failure modes tracked	Absent
Cross-Agent Memory	Portable shared context	Enforced
4. Self-Awareness & Progress Tracking
Capability	Description	Status
Institutional State	Forge knows what mode it’s in	Enforced
Automation Trajectory Awareness	Forge knows it’s building itself	Operational
Capability Gap Detection	Forge can say “what’s missing”	Operational
Roadmap Self-Reference	Forge can reason about this roadmap	Defined
5. Automation Readiness
Capability	Description	Status
Machine-Addressable Artifacts	Stable file locations & formats	Operational
CI / Validation Hooks	Automated checks possible	Absent
Agent Onboarding Without Re-Explanation	Plug-in ready	Defined
Reduced Human Orchestration	Fewer manual decisions	Defined
Roadmap Usage Rules

Capabilities move forward only with artifacts

“Operational” requires real usage, not theory

“Enforced” means agents actively block violations

“Automatable” requires zero human judgment

Agents must reference this roadmap when:

proposing Forge evolution

claiming readiness for automation

deciding what to build next

System Self-Signpost

The Roadmap now exposes two concrete gaps:

No Anti-Patterns artifact (memory gap)

No Product-level state tracking equivalent to Forge State

The second is required to satisfy dual-track continuity.
