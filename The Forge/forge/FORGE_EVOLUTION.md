🔁 FORGE_EVOLUTION.md

Status: Canonical · Self-Modification Protocol
Audience: All agents and Director
Purpose: Govern how the Forge improves itself while progressing toward automation
Meta-Objective: Every evolution step must reduce manual coordination over time

1. Principle of Directed Self-Evolution

The Forge is explicitly aware that it is building itself toward automation.

Therefore:

Every approved process change must:

reduce ambiguity

reduce repeated explanation

increase artifact-driven execution

or unlock future automation hooks

Process changes that do not advance this trajectory are invalid.

2. What May Evolve

The following may be evolved through this protocol:

Forge process rules

Artifact structures

Required files and their locations

Agent prompting and enforcement behaviour

Review cadence and feedback loops

Automation readiness criteria

The following may not evolve implicitly:

Forge Kernel invariants

Authority hierarchy

Dual-track doctrine

Narrative-first Director accommodation

Those require explicit Director approval and Kernel update.

3. Evolution Proposal Format (Mandatory)

Any agent may propose an evolution using the following structure:

Evolution ID

Format: E-YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>

Motivation (Narrative)

What friction, failure, or opportunity prompted this?

Current Limitation

What the Forge cannot currently do well.

Proposed Change

What is being altered or added.

Automation Vector

Explicitly state how this change moves the Forge closer to automation.
Examples:

enables machine validation

reduces human decision points

creates stable interfaces

makes state inspectable

Trial Scope

files affected

duration or conditions

whether parallel to other experiments

Success Signals

Observable indicators the change is beneficial.

Failure / Rollback Signals

Clear criteria for reverting.

4. Parallel Experiment Doctrine (Your Choice C)

The Forge explicitly allows multiple concurrent evolution experiments, with the following rules:

Experiments must be isolated by:

scope

artifact

or explicit labeling

Conflicting experiments may coexist temporarily

No experiment becomes canonical without reconciliation

This allows creative exploration without institutional drift.

5. Reconciliation & Canonisation

At defined intervals (or when tension arises):

Experiments are compared

Trade-offs are surfaced

One of the following outcomes occurs:

Canonise one

Merge aspects

Deprecate all

Canonised changes must:

update relevant Forge artifacts

be recorded as a Forge Lesson

increment the Forge’s automation readiness

6. Director’s Role in Evolution

The Director:

does not need to micromanage experiments

does decide what becomes law

may reject evolution on values, not just efficiency

Agents must present:

clear summaries

explicit trade-offs

automation impact

7. Automation Readiness Tracking (Critical)

Every evolution must incrementally answer:

“What human decision or coordination step does this remove or simplify?”

If the answer is “none”, the evolution is invalid.

This rule is absolute.

8. Self-Signposting Rule

When an evolution is canonised, the Forge must explicitly state:

what new capability is unlocked

what new artifact or automation hook is now possible

what the next natural step is

This is how the process pushes itself forward.
