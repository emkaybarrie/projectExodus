Role: Canonical understanding of MyFi’s purpose, mechanics, and architecture

How to Use This Document

This document is the foundational reference for understanding MyFi.

It serves three simultaneous purposes:

A human-readable product bible — narrative, intention-driven, editable.

A shared truth surface — what MyFi is, is not, and is becoming.

A bridge to automation — selected sections are expected to remain aligned with the live codebase, while others intentionally describe future intent.

Not every section is equally binding. Some describe non-negotiable intent, others describe current reality, and others remain exploratory.

When this document and the codebase diverge, the divergence is not an error — it is a signal that reconciliation or deliberate evolution is required.

1. Mission & Philosophy

MyFi exists to help people build financial resilience through awareness, pacing, and intentional decision-making — not through restriction, shame, or opaque optimisation.

At its core, MyFi reframes personal finance as a trainable system, not a moral test.

The product treats financial behaviour as something that can be:

observed without judgement

influenced through feedback and reflection

strengthened over time through practice

Game systems are used not to distract from reality, but to translate reality into a form the human brain can feel and act on.

2. Ethics & Safeguards

MyFi is explicitly non-advisory.

The system:

does not tell users what they should do

does not optimise for extraction or addiction

does not reward harmful behaviour

Core principles:

Agency over coercion — depth increases only when the player chooses it.

Readability over optimisation — signals are understandable, not hidden.

Safety over growth — especially when real financial data is involved.

Separation of domains — real-world financial outcomes are never gamified competitively.

Any feature or monetisation mechanism must satisfy these principles or be rejected.

3. The Core Behaviour Engine (Vitals)

MyFi models financial behaviour through a small set of energy-like resources (“Vitals”). These are metaphors, but they map directly to real financial dynamics.

3.1 The Vitals

Health
Survival and emergency capacity. Depletion signals fragility, not failure.

Mana
Intentional, high-impact spending. Mana represents choice and power.

Stamina
Day-to-day flexible spending. It regenerates frequently and absorbs routine activity.

Essence
Long-term surplus and savings potential. Essence accrues through sustained positive behaviour and is ethically ring-fenced.

Vitals are designed to teach pacing, trade-offs, and recovery, not optimisation.

4. The Spirit Hub — Heart of the Player Experience

The Spirit Hub is the heart of MyFi from the player’s perspective.

It has two inseparable functions:

4.1 The Hub as a Financial HUD (Health Readout)

First, the Hub functions as a living HUD for the player’s financial health.

Much like a fitness wearable translates complex physiological data into readable bars and signals, the Hub translates financial reality into game-native vitals:

Health, Mana, Stamina, Essence

Shields, regeneration, depletion

Visual states that reflect pressure or stability

At this layer, the player uses the Hub as a mirror, not as a game:

“My stamina is low — maybe I skip that extra drink.”
“My health buffer is thin — I should tread carefully.”

The player is influencing real-world behaviour through identification with their avatar, not through instruction.

This layer is always present and always readable.

4.2 The Hub as a Window into the Avatar’s World (Encounters)

Second, the Hub is a window into the avatar’s lived world.

Here, real financial events (especially spending events) are translated into encounters that play out using game logic.

By default, encounters resolve in an autobattler-like manner:

events occur

vitals are impacted

outcomes are visible

no immediate action is required

This ensures:

low friction

no cognitive overload

continuity even when the player is busy or disengaged

4.3 Interaction Depth: Autobattler → Turn-Based

When the player chooses to engage with an encounter, the system collapses into a turn-based interaction regime:

time slows or effectively pauses

discrete choices become available

tactical actions can be taken deliberately

outcomes become more explicit and learnable

This is not a separate mode, but a deepening of interaction.

The design intent is:

passive observation is always safe

engagement is always rewarded with clarity and agency

attention is treated as a scarce, valuable resource

5. Interaction Depth Continuum

MyFi is designed around a continuum of interaction depth, not discrete game modes:

HUD → Autobattler → Turn-Based → Action (Badlands)

HUD
Always-on awareness and self-regulation.

Autobattler
Encounters resolve automatically, readable but low effort.

Turn-Based
Player intervention introduces tactical decision-making.

Action / Badlands
High-engagement, expressive gameplay that externalises progress and identity.

Players may move forwards and backwards along this continuum at any time. No layer is mandatory.

6. Quests & Behavioural Encounters

Quests are structured prompts that:

guide reflection

encourage specific behaviours

frame financial moments as meaningful experiences

They are not chores, checklists, or objectives in isolation.

A quest may represent:

establishing a buffer

surviving a difficult period

reviewing spending patterns

choosing restraint or intentionality

Quests often act as entry points into deeper interaction along the continuum, especially into turn-based moments.

7. Architecture — Conceptual Model

MyFi’s UI and interaction architecture is built around a preferred conceptual model:

Surfaces — high-level contexts (Hub, Quests, Profile)

Slots — named layout regions within a surface

Parts — reusable, self-contained UI units

Journeys — thin orchestration flows across surfaces

Feature Packs — stable capability providers (data + actions)

This model is strongly preferred and assumed by tooling and AI workflows, but it is not immutable law. Any departure must be deliberate and explicit.

8. Current Architectural Reality

At present:

The Hub/Vitals surface is the canonical anchor

The system is mobile-first, with a no-build ESM runtime

Surfaces / Slots / Parts are implemented and stabilising

Quests are the intended reference implementation for repeatable workflows

Backend integrations are abstracted behind feature interfaces

Some architectural details remain in flux and are expected to evolve alongside the codebase.

9. The Badlands (Action Layer)

The Badlands represent the deepest point on the interaction continuum.

They exist to:

express identity

externalise long-term progress

provide narrative and emotional payoff

They must never:

create financial pressure

distort real-world outcomes

incentivise risky behaviour for in-game gain

The Badlands consume signals from MyFi — they do not control it.

10. Commercial & Partner Model

MyFi supports:

public-good partnerships

institutional pilots

ethical monetisation

All monetisation must be:

optional

non-exploitative

compatible with safeguarding

never required to access core functionality

11. Roadmap & Open Questions

Development is structured into Acts, representing capability maturity rather than time.

Some questions remain intentionally open:

How deep should tactical play become for advanced users?

Where is the optimal boundary between automation and reflection?

How expressive should the Badlands become without distorting finance?

These are not failures — they are designed spaces for learning.

Closing Note

This document is not static.

It is expected to:

evolve alongside the product

be challenged by implementation reality

inform and be informed by the codebase

When this document and the system disagree, the disagreement is valuable.
