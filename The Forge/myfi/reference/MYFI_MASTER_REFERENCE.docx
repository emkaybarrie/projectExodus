How to Use This Document

This document is the foundational reference for understanding MyFi.

It serves three simultaneous purposes:

A human-readable product bible — narrative, intention-driven, editable.

A shared truth surface — what MyFi is, is not, and is becoming.

A bridge to automation — sections of this document are expected to remain aligned with the live codebase, while others intentionally describe future intent.

Not every section is equally binding. Some describe non-negotiable intent, others describe current reality, and others remain exploratory. This distinction is essential to keeping MyFi coherent as it evolves.

Conflicts between this document and the codebase are not errors — they are signals that reconciliation or deliberate evolution is required.

1. Mission & Philosophy

MyFi exists to help people build financial resilience through awareness, pacing, and intentional decision-making — not through restriction, shame, or opaque optimisation.

At its core, MyFi reframes personal finance as a trainable system, not a moral test.

The product treats financial behaviour as something that can be:

observed without judgement

influenced through feedback and reflection

strengthened over time through practice

Game systems are used not to distract from reality, but to make reality legible and emotionally navigable.

2. Ethics & Safeguards

MyFi is explicitly non-advisory.

The system:

does not tell users what they should do

does not optimise for extraction or addiction

does not reward harmful behaviour

Key ethical principles:

Agency over coercion — engagement deepens only when the user chooses it.

Transparency over optimisation — mechanics are understandable, not hidden.

Safety over growth — especially in verified modes.

Separation of domains — real financial outcomes are never directly gamified for competitive gain.

Any monetisation or progression system must be compatible with these principles or be rejected.

3. The Core Behaviour Engine (Vitals)

MyFi models financial behaviour through a small set of energy-like resources (“Vitals”). These are metaphors, but they map directly to real financial dynamics.

3.1 The Vitals

Health
Represents survival and emergency capacity. When Health is depleted, the system signals fragility rather than punishment.

Mana
Represents intentional, high-impact spending. Mana is about choice and power, not frequency.

Stamina
Represents day-to-day flexible spending. It regenerates more frequently and absorbs routine activity.

Essence
Represents long-term surplus, savings, and investment potential. Essence is ethically ring-fenced and accumulates through sustained positive behaviour.

These resources are not arbitrary meters — they are designed to teach pacing, trade-offs, and recovery.

4. The Spirit Hub — Autobattler ↔ Turn-Based Hybrid

The Spirit Hub (often referred to simply as the Hub) is the core experiential surface of MyFi.

It is best understood as a hybrid system:

By default, the Hub behaves like an autobattler:

state changes flow continuously

vitals rise and fall based on real-world activity

the system remains readable without constant attention

When the user engages proactively, the system collapses into a turn-based mode:

time effectively slows or pauses

discrete choices become available

tactical actions can be taken deliberately

This is not a mode switch. It is a continuum of interaction depth.

The design intent is that:

passive users are never overwhelmed

engaged users are rewarded with agency and clarity

attention is treated as a scarce, valuable resource

4.1 Tactical Agency

When operating in the turn-based regime, the player may:

tag or reclassify spending

make intentional trade-offs

deploy limited abilities or mitigations

reflect on recent actions with clearer feedback

Tactical depth is earned through engagement, not forced by default.

5. Quests & Encounters

Quests are structured prompts that:

guide reflection

encourage specific behaviours

frame financial actions as meaningful events

They are not chores, and they are not objectives in isolation.

A quest may represent:

setting a buffer

reviewing a category

surviving a difficult period

choosing restraint or intentionality

Quests operate as behavioural encounters, not traditional tasks, and often interface directly with the Hub’s turn-based moments.

6. Architecture — Conceptual Model

MyFi’s UI and interaction architecture is built around a preferred conceptual model:

Surfaces
High-level screens or contexts (e.g. Hub, Quests, Profile).

Slots
Named regions within a surface that define layout responsibility.

Parts
Reusable, self-contained UI units that mount into slots.

Journeys
Thin orchestration flows that move the user across surfaces and states.

Feature Packs
Stable capability providers that expose data and actions to the UI.

This model is strongly preferred and assumed by tooling and AI workflows, but it is not treated as religious law. If a superior model emerges, migration is allowed — but must be deliberate and explicit.

7. Current Architectural Reality

As of this reference:

The Hub/Vitals screen is the canonical anchor.

The system is mobile-first, with a no-build, ESM-based runtime.

Surfaces / Slots / Parts are implemented and stabilising.

Quests are the intended reference implementation for repeatable UI and journey workflows.

Backend integrations are abstracted behind feature interfaces.

Some architectural details remain in flux. This document is expected to be updated as the repo evolves.

8. The Game Layer (Badlands)

The Badlands represent a separate but connected domain.

They exist to:

express identity

externalise progress

provide narrative continuity

They must never:

create financial pressure

distort real-world outcomes

encourage risk for in-game advantage

The Badlands consume signals from MyFi, not control it.

9. Commercial & Partner Model

MyFi is designed to support:

public-good partnerships

institutional pilots

ethical monetisation

Monetisation principles:

optional

non-exploitative

compatible with safeguarding

never required to access core functionality

Any partner integration must respect the behavioural and ethical constraints defined earlier in this document.

10. Roadmap & Open Questions

MyFi development is structured into Acts, representing capability maturity rather than time.

Some questions remain intentionally open:

How deep should tactical play become for advanced users?

How much automation is appropriate before reflection is lost?

Where is the optimal boundary between guidance and autonomy?

These questions are not failures — they are designed spaces for learning.

Closing Note

This document is not static.

It is expected to:

evolve alongside the product

be challenged by implementation reality

inform and be informed by the codebase

When this document and the system disagree, the disagreement is valuable.
