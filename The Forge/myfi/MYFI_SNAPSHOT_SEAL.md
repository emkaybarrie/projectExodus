# MyFi Snapshot Seal

**Status:** Sealed snapshot of product truth  
**Date sealed:** 2026-01-22  
**Sealed by:** Director (Emkay)  
**Scope:** Validates the onboarding artifacts under /myfi as the accepted current truth.

## Included artifacts
- PRODUCT_STATE.md
- MYFI_ONBOARDING.md
- MYFI_CAPSULE.md
- MYFI_GLOSSARY.md
- MYFI_ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md
- MYFI_STATUS_MATRIX.md
- MYFI_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md
- MYFI_MANIFEST.json

## Director statement
I confirm that the above artifacts accurately represent:
- what MyFi is
- where development currently stands
- what is stable vs in flux
- what risks are active
as of the seal date.

## Notes / exceptions
None.

## Next step self-signpost
With this seal in place, the next automation step is:
- repo-aware reconciliation by an Executor (Claude) to detect deltas between code reality and the sealed product truth,
  emitted as Work Orders (no code changes in the reconciliation pass).
