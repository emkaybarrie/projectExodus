## 1) Mission
MyFi exists to train resilient financial behaviour through a game-like system that rewards awareness, pacing, and intentionality—without exploiting users.

---

## 2) Core Model (Non-negotiable intent)
### 2.1 Vitals
- Health = survival / emergency buffer
- Mana = intentional / power spending
- Stamina = day-to-day flexible spending
- Essence = long-term savings/investment potential; ethically ring-fenced

### 2.2 Behavioural loop
Real-world spending → fast tagging → reduced “damage” → regen/underspend → Essence accrual → review → narrative progression.

---

## 3) Ethics (Non-negotiable intent)
- No dark patterns.
- Verified mode is designed to protect users from harm.
- Microtransactions (if any) must be ethically constrained and optional.

---

## 4) Product Direction (Mutable, but coherent)
- Mobile-first.
- Hub/Vitals is the anchor.
- Quests and Journeys are the primary “training rails”.
- Game layer (Badlands) is Phase 2+ and must not distort real-world outcomes.

---

## 5) Design Tone (Mutable)
- Arcane + western anime fantasy vibe
- Calm, clean UI with magical accents
- Narrative framing is a feature, not decoration
